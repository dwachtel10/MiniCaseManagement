# MiniCaseManagement
The folder CaseManagementv4 contains the SQL project that initializes the database. The post-deployment script should populate the database with some test data.

As it stands, this program should be able to create, update, and delete records of three types: CaseMaster(representing the identifying features of a case), CaseDetails(information about the defendants in the case), and Charges(information about the charges involved in the case), albeit on separate pages.
